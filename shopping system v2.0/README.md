Second version of my mini project

added:
You can now choose to pick a different amount if you tried to order / return too much

improved:
The 2 list of dictionaries relationship is less fragile, the "basket" now generates based off what is in stock. Same goes for menus, instead of being hardcoded they
print based off what is  in stock.

Some logic has been cleaned up (e.g. the code checks if there is enough stock before doing the calculation, instead of checking after and just re rolling back to the
previous state) but functionality remains the same.

I split up every main menu option into functions and stored them in seperate files, then importing them into the main program.

what i learned:
How to import functions from another folder and file
How to generate a list of dictionaries based of one which is already made instead of hard coding it each time



I tried my best to check this new version for logic errors but working backwards proves to be much more difficult than if I were to re write it from scratch.

Once I learn OOP i might make a version 3 using it.
I might also add a seperate program which allows the user to change the items, prices, stock saving it in a seperate file then loading it into the main program.


P.S  For version 2 to work you must download the whole shopping system v2.0 folder , it contains the main program and all the functions used in it inside the
functions folder.
